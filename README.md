# OBM (Osu!-background-manager)

## This utility will help you with replacement of Osu!`s beatmap backgrounds (and more in the future)

**Use at your own risk !**
There is no way to return removed original backgrounds unless you delete all beatmaps and reimport newly downloaded versions of them again.
